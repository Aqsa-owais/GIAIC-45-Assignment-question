// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list
// of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write
// a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries:string[] = ["USA","canada","France","Germany","Japan"];
// print list of countries
console.log("List of countries:", countries.forEach(country => {
    console.log(country);
