//question 6
//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters
// at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character
// combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace
// around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white
// spaces


let personName:string = "\t \n Aqsa Owais \t \n"
console.log(`Name With white space: ${personName}`);


let trippedname:string = personName.trim();
console.log("Name Without white space:",trippedname);
